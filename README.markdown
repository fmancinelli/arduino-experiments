Arduino experiments
===================

This project contains the experiments I did with my Arduino board. 

In each subdirectory you will find the source code of the program needed to make the experiment work, and pictures documenting the electrical schemas for builing the needed hardware support (`.sch` files are readable using [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/)
